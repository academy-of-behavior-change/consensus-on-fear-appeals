# Towards consensus on fear appeals

This repository contains more detailed discussion of the commentaries on the provocative article [Ignoring theory and misinterpreting evidence: the false belief in fear appeals](https://doi.org/10.1080/17437199.2017.1415767). To enable a constructive, collaborative focus in the rejoinder, as well as do justice to the thoughtful comments without exceeding the 1500 word boundary for commentaries and rejoinders, we decided to include the point-by-point responses in this supplementary appendix.

The final supplementary file is hosted at the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/a2v46/).
